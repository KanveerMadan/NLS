        <div class="d4">
            <p><strong>I was deeply drawn to the idea of building a legal service that focuses not just on documentation, but on the people behind the papers.</strong> When I started Nirankari Legal Services in 2007, the vision was simple‚Äîmake legal help accessible, 
                affordable, and human-centered. Since then, every step of our journey has been about delivering clarity and trust to clients, especially NRIs and individuals struggling with paperwork in Delhi NCR.</p>
            <p><strong>I‚Äôve had several transformative moments in my career‚Äîone of the most powerful was realizing how much clarity and peace of mind we can bring to someone by solving even a single documentation issue.</strong>
                 Whether it‚Äôs a woman fighting for her right in a matrimonial case or an NRI waiting on a delayed apostille, I see law as a way to empower. Over time, I shaped NLS into a full-fledged support system, not just a legal consultancy.</p>
            <p><strong>Working with people across India and abroad has made me realize that the law may be national, but legal struggles are deeply personal.</strong> That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve designed our services around end-to-end assistance. From court marriage registration, translation, affidavits to final apostille or courier overseas‚Äîwe‚Äôve streamlined every step for the client. Even NRIs can get their documents handled remotely, securely, and with full transparency.</p>
            <p><strong>What keeps me going is the belief that ethics, empathy, and efficiency can coexist in law.</strong> My social work background helps me understand vulnerable clients better, while my legal experience enables me to act with confidence. Clients often share that they feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äútaken care of‚Äù at our office‚Äîand that‚Äôs my biggest success.</p>
            <p>If I had to define my mission in one line, it would be this:<i> "Deliver legal clarity with compassion and conviction."</i> And every consultation, every form we fill, every document we stamp‚Äîis a step in that direction.</p>
