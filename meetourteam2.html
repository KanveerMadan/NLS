            <p><strong>I started practicing law with one simple belief, no one should feel powerless in front of the legal system.</strong> 
                The courtroom is intimidating for many, but justice begins with understanding your rights, and being fearlessly represented. Over the years, I‚Äôve focused on building that confidence in every client who walks through my door.</p>
            <p><strong>I remember my first major criminal case ,the stakes were high, the evidence complex, and the client was losing hope. </strong>
                But what it taught me is that precision, preparation, and persistence always pay off.
                 Whether it‚Äôs getting an FIR quashed or fighting a false accusation, I approach every matter as if it's the most important one  because for the client, it always is.</p>
            <p>Working at Tis Hazari Court has given me insights into how our justice system operates on the ground ‚Äî not just by the letter of the law, but by the realities of human lives entangled in it. That‚Äôs why I emphasize<strong>straightforward legal advice, strong courtroom advocacy, and full transparency.</strong> </p>
            <p> In recent years, I‚Äôve also advised several NRIs and outstation clients ‚Äî helping them resolve legal issues in India while living abroad. It‚Äôs about trust. And when someone places their matter in your hands from thousands of miles away, you make sure it gets done efficiently, ethically, and end-to-end.</p>
            <p><strong>If there‚Äôs one line that defines my practice, it‚Äôs this:</strong><i> ‚ÄúJustice isn‚Äôt just about winning cases ‚Äî it‚Äôs about restoring dignity.‚Äù</i> </p>
